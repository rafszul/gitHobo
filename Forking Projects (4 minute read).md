Forking Projects (4 minute read)
https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/index.html

For this tutorial, we’ll be using the Spoon-Knife project, a test repository that’s hosted on GitHub.com that lets you test the Pull Request workflow and the GitHub Desktop application. To download the desktop application, head over to https://mac.github.com or https://windows.github.com depending on your operating system.


Go ahead and make a few changes to the project using your favorite text editor, like [Atom][1] (https://atom.io/). You could, for example, change the text in index.html to add your GitHub username.
